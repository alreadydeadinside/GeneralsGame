# Generals Game
Simple game, known as "Generals"

# Rules
Five dice are used. The number of players is not limited. The winner is the one with the most points. Who will go first is determined by the lot. The bones are thrown alternately. The player with the lowest score starts. In the future, they walk alternately clockwise. Each game has 10 rounds. A player has the right to make no more than three throws in one round.

Winning combinations:

general - 5 identical bones (for example: 5-5-5-5-5);

four - 4 identical bones (for example: 5-5-5-5-1);

full house - 2 + 3 (for example: 5 + 5 and 1 + 1 + 1);

straight - a sequence of all five possible points in a circle (for example: 1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6)

If the player gets an unsatisfactory combination, he can, guided by tactical considerations, try to change the situation. He has the right to reroll all the dice or some part of them.

One can play the role of a joker, but only in a straight combination. She has the right to replace only two or six.

Winning combinations have their own fixed value in points, and the combination made on the second and third attempts has less value. If a general is thrown out on the first try (in any round), he is called a great general and ends the game - the one who succeeds wins. The general who came out on the second or third attempt is called a minor general. He does not complete the game, but is worth 60 points.

The price of winning combinations:

four - 45 (on the first try); 40 (from the second and third);

2 + 3 - 35 (on the first try); 30 (from the second and third);

Street - 25 (on the first try); 20 (second and third)

If the above combinations have not been rolled, the player can score to himself the points that fell to him on the last roll of the dice. Only the same numbers are taken into account. For example, 4-1-5-2-2 is thrown. You can write yourself either two deuces or one five.

The course of the game is signed in a special table, where the names of the participants are written horizontally, and the sums received for combinations or simple points are written vertically. There are ten vertical columns in total: ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, street, full house, four and general.

Note: each combination can only be used once. That is, if the player has already typed, for example, a full house, then this column in the table is already filled, and he has to choose a different combination.

If, during one of the first throws, the player dropped out, for example, two deuces, a four and a six, he should not be guided by the primitive advantage of simple addition and write down a six for himself. Indeed, in the next round, he may fall (in the absence of winning combinations) two or even three sixes, which will give 12 or 18 points. Perhaps it would be more logical to stop at a pair of twos. It is clear that at the end of the game the tactics will be somewhat different.
